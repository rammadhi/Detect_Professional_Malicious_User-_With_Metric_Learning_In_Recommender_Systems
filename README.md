# Detecting Professional Malicious Users in Recommender Systems Using Metric Learning

Overview

This project applies Metric Learning to identify malicious users in recommender systems. Using a Siamese Neural Network and Triplet Loss, the model learns user behavior patterns and detects anomalies that indicate fraudulent activity.

Features

> Identifies malicious users manipulating recommendations

> Uses Metric Learning to differentiate normal vs. malicious users

> Implements Siamese Neural Network for user embeddings

> Trains with Triplet Loss to improve anomaly detection

> Improves recommendation accuracy by removing fake users


Concepts Used

* Recommender Systems – Collaborative filtering to predict user preferences

* Metric Learning – Learning a similarity function instead of using predefined distances

* Siamese Neural Networks – Learning embeddings to compare user behavior

* Triplet Loss – Ensuring malicious users are far from normal users in embedding space

* Anomaly Detection – Identifying users who differ significantly from normal patterns


Real-World Applications

> E-commerce (Amazon, Flipkart) – Detects fake reviews and fraudulent purchases

> Streaming Services (Netflix, Spotify) – Identifies bot-generated views and ratings

> Social Media (YouTube, TikTok) – Detects artificial likes and engagement manipulation

> Financial Fraud Detection – Flags unusual transaction behavior
