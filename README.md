# Detecting Professional Malicious Users in Recommender Systems Using Metric Learning

#Overview

This project applies Metric Learning to identify malicious users in recommender systems. Using a Siamese Neural Network and Triplet Loss, the model learns user behavior patterns and detects anomalies that indicate fraudulent activity.

#Features

âœ” Identifies malicious users manipulating recommendations

âœ” Uses Metric Learning to differentiate normal vs. malicious users

âœ” Implements Siamese Neural Network for user embeddings

âœ” Trains with Triplet Loss to improve anomaly detection

âœ” Improves recommendation accuracy by removing fake users


#Concepts Used

âœ” Recommender Systems â€“ Collaborative filtering to predict user preferences

âœ” Metric Learning â€“ Learning a similarity function instead of using predefined distances

âœ” Siamese Neural Networks â€“ Learning embeddings to compare user behavior

âœ” Triplet Loss â€“ Ensuring malicious users are far from normal users in embedding space

âœ” Anomaly Detection â€“ Identifying users who differ significantly from normal patterns


#Real-World Applications

ðŸ“Œ E-commerce (Amazon, Flipkart) â€“ Detects fake reviews and fraudulent purchases

ðŸ“Œ Streaming Services (Netflix, Spotify) â€“ Identifies bot-generated views and ratings

ðŸ“Œ Social Media (YouTube, TikTok) â€“ Detects artificial likes and engagement manipulation

ðŸ“Œ Financial Fraud Detection â€“ Flags unusual transaction behavior
